SB Squares — Release Notes
===========================

v6.4.0 — 2026-02-09
--------------------
Redesigned square claiming to a sequential 3-step wizard.

Users were confused by the previous all-in-one form — they
missed filling in initials because the screen had too much
going on. Now each step gets its own focused screen:

Step 1: Enter your initials (2-3 letters)
Step 2: Pick how many squares (no default — must choose)
Step 3: Choose pick method (auto or manual)

Also improved auto-select: random picks now spread across
different rows and columns instead of pure random. If you
pick 5 squares, they'll try to land in 5 different rows
and 5 different columns for better grid coverage.

v6.3.6 — 2026-02-09
--------------------
Stable release for Super Bowl LX.

Features:
- Multi-game support with real-time Firebase sync
- Join games via share code or QR code
- Configurable payout structures and scoring modes
- Random or manual square selection
- Quarter-by-quarter scoring with winner detection
- Sound effects for interactions
- Dark theme with Patriots/Seahawks branding
